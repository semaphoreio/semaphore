## Semaphore Versions

Semaphore comes in three flavors to fit your needs:

### 🌱 Community Edition

Free and open source under [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE). This is what you'll find in this repository (everything outside the `ee/` folder). Perfect for teams who want to run Semaphore on their own infrastructure with community support.

### 🏢 Enterprise Edition

Our enhanced version with extra features for larger organizations, available under a commercial license. You'll find this code in the `ee/` directory. Comes with professional support to keep your CI/CD running smoothly.

### ☁️ Semaphore Cloud

Don't want to manage your own infrastructure? Our hosted version at [semaphoreci.com](https://semaphoreci.com) gives you all the power of Semaphore without the setup. From free plans for small projects to enterprise-scale solutions.
