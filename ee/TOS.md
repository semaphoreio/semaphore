Where you sign up for any of the Services using an e-mail address from your employer or another entity then you shall be deemed to represent such party and any acceptance of these Terms of Service (in line with their provisions) will bind your employer or such other entity that you represent.

## 1. Acceptance of terms

Semaphore offers a variety of software products, such as software testing tools, application program interfaces (APIs) and business software, available to the Customers on-premises, including the Semaphore CI/CD runner, a platform which is downloaded, installed, and used on computer servers of the Customer in Customer's own environment (collectively, "**Services**", and each individual service, a "**Service**").

For services offered by Semaphore at the [https://semaphore.io](https://semaphore.io/) website (the "**Site**") or through hybrid hosting, please refer to the Terms of Service for these particular products of Semaphore, available elsewhere at the Site.

The Terms of Service are in addition to (not in lieu of) any other agreement (whether in writing or clickwrap) that you enter into with Semaphore (now or in the future) regarding any of the Services (the "**Primary Agreement**"). If there is any conflict or inconsistency between any provision of the Terms of Service and any Primary Agreement, the provision of the Primary Agreement shall [prevail.](http://prevail.da)

## 2. Changes

Semaphore reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace the Terms of Service (including any Policy), in whole or in part, at any time.

Change notices may be communicated by postings at the Site and/or by electronic mail. In any case, the Customer should periodically check the Terms of Service for changes. Continued use of the Site or any of the Services following notice of any change constitutes Customer's acceptance of that change. The Terms of Service may not be amended otherwise (i.e. other than in the manner provided by this provision), except by a written agreement executed by the Customer and Semaphore.

## 3. Eligibility

The Services are available only to users that can form legally binding contracts under applicable law (and in the case of individuals, who are at least 18 years old).

The Community Edition of the Software is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. This edition is intended for general use, including development, testing, and deployment, without requiring a paid subscription.

**5.2 Enterprise Edition (Commercial License)**
The Enterprise Edition of the Software is provided under a separate commercial license agreement [(the “Enterprise License”)](https://github.com/semaphoreio/semaphore/blob/main/ee/LICENSE.). Use of the Enterprise Edition is subject to the terms set forth in the Enterprise License Agreement, which governs permitted use, restrictions, support, updates, and other rights. A valid subscription or license is required to access and use the Enterprise Edition.

**5.3 Free Plan Eligibility**
Semaphore may offer access to the Enterprise Edition under a “Free Plan” to qualifying organizations. Eligibility is limited to organizations with fewer than 50 users and less than $5 million USD in annual recurring revenue (ARR). Use of the Free Plan is conditional on compliance with these criteria. By using the Free Plan, you certify that your organization meets these conditions. If your organization exceeds these thresholds, you agree to promptly notify Semaphore and obtain a commercial license. Continued use of the Enterprise Edition after exceeding eligibility requirements without notification may result in license termination or retroactive fees.

**5.4 Restrictions**
Unless explicitly authorized under the applicable license, you may not:
 - Use the Enterprise Edition without a valid license or subscription;
 - Use the Community Edition in violation of the Apache 2.0 license;
 - Circumvent access controls or usage limits applicable to your plan or edition.


Use of the Enterprise Edition is governed exclusively by the applicable Enterprise License Agreement. Unless expressly permitted under that license or under applicable law, the Customer shall not, directly or indirectly:
(a) use the Services or any Software or other information gained from the Site, or gained through the access or use of the Services, to create any software, platform or documentation that is similar to any of the Software, Platform or Documentation or for any other purpose other than for the access to and use of the Site and the Services, (b) attempt to access any Platform component or to disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise discover any source code or underlying organization, structures, ideas or algorithms of the Platform or (except and only to the extent these restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable statutory law) the Software, (c) encumber, sublicense, distribute, transfer, rent, lease, lend or use the Software in any time-share or service bureau arrangement, (d) copy, adapt, combine, create derivative works of, translate, localize, port or otherwise modify any Software or Documentation, (e) use the Software, or allow the transfer, transmission, export or re-export of all or any part of the Software or any product thereof, in violation of any export control laws or regulations of the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction or (f) permit any third party to do any of the foregoing.

Each User under the license shall have a unique user account, as managed and maintained by the Customer. Customer shall be responsible for safeguarding the security of each user account under the license. Multiple Users may not use the same user account.

Customer may make a reasonable number of copies of the Software and Documentation only for inactive backup purposes. Customer's access and use of the Services and Software shall comply with all other conditions set forth herein, at the Site (to the extent they are applicable to the Services obtained by the Customer) or in Customer's order for the Services (such as, for example, any requirements regarding data formats, number of users, size limits, time limits or prohibited uses), as well as the mandatory provisions of the applicable laws. 

**Systems**. At its sole cost and expense, Customer is responsible for providing all (a) modems, servers, devices, storage, software, databases, network and communications equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access or otherwise use the Services from Customer's facility and (b) corresponding backup, recovery, network security and maintenance services (collectively, "**Customer Systems**"). Customer shall ensure that Customer Systems are compatible with the Services and comply with all configurations and specifications described at the Site, the Primary Agreement or in the Documentation. The Customer represents and warrants that the Services may not work on all Customer Systems, and that Semaphore will not be liable to remedy or compensate for such cases. The Customer represents and warrants that it owns rights or holds a license to any Customer Systems on which the Services are installed, and that it is solely responsible for the configuration, security, and maintenance of such Customer Systems.

**Limitations**. Bearing in mind that the Services are completely dependent on the environment in which the Customer stores or uses the Services, Semaphore will not be responsible or liable for continuous making available of the Services with the Customer, nor any failure in the Services regardless of its cause, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable laws.

**Support**. Subject to the conditions of the Support Service Level Agreement, Semaphore will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with technical support and updates for the Services in accordance with its standard practices and the Support Service Level Agreement. Semaphore has no obligation to support any version other than the then current version. Customer agrees that Semaphore may charge in accordance with its then current policies and the Support Service Level Agreement (if applicable) for any support service resulting from problems, errors or inquiries related to the Customer Data or Customer Systems

Semaphore will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with technical support and updates for the Services in accordance with its standard support practices or, if applicable, a separate Support Service Level Agreement ("SLA").

You shall not sell, license, rent, or otherwise use or exploit any Content for commercial use or in any way that violates any third party right. 

Some Content will be marked on the Service as "Creative Commons Content". Creative Commons Content will be identified with a Creative Commons icon. Semaphore hereby grants each user of the Services a license to Creative Commons Content under the Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International license, available at the [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) website.

Semaphore will not intentionally disclose, distribute, transmit or use any information received from the Customer except (a) as reasonably necessary for Semaphore (or its contractors) to provide the Software, (b) as authorized by the Customer or otherwise expressly permitted under the Terms of Service, or (c) as required by court order, law or regulation, or if Semaphore reasonably believes that such action is necessary to conform or comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, to protect or defend the rights or property of Semaphore or any third party or to enforce the Terms of Service or any Primary Agreement.

Unless agreed otherwise, Customer consents to inclusion of its name and logos in customer lists that may be published as part of Semaphore's marketing and promotional efforts.

## 9. Fees

Except as expressly provided below, Semaphore and Customer are each solely responsible for its own costs and expenses related to the Services.

At prices agreed mutually by Semaphore and the Customer, Semaphore charges fees for accessing and using the Services, which are subject to change in Semaphore's sole discretion. Price changes for Customers using the Services will be made known to the Customer in accordance with Section 2. If Customer elects to access or use the Services, Customer agrees to pay all applicable fees resulting from all use of that Service under its account, in the amounts, at the times and subject to any specified conditions. Such fees may be specified as being payable in advance or in arrears; fees may be fixed, contingent or variable (e.g., depending on usage factors); and fees may be specified on a recurring basis (e.g., subscription fees and/or usage fees, which may be payable monthly, quarterly or annually). Usually, we offer a one or two year license for our Services, paid in advance and calculated per User, nevertheless, this approach may change from time to time to the discretion of Semaphore.

Unless specified otherwise, all amounts due hereunder shall be paid upon order in US dollars, in immediately available funds by credit card account, in full without set-off, counterclaim or deduction. If any payment is past due, Semaphore shall have the right to take whatever action it deems appropriate (including without limitation, suspending or terminating Customer's account or its access and use of the Services). Customer agrees to reimburse Semaphore for all reasonable costs (including attorneys' fees) incurred in collecting payments. All payments to Semaphore are exclusive of state, local and foreign taxes, duties, tariffs, levies, withholdings and similar assessments (including without limitation, sales taxes, use taxes and value added taxes), and Customer agrees to bear and be liable for the payment of all such charges (excluding taxes based upon the Semaphore's net income). All payments paid or payable to Semaphore are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable.

**Confidential Information**. Confidential Information means any and all information provided by Semaphore, including persons acting on its behalf, to the Customer, as well as all other information otherwise obtained (learned) by the Customer during and in relation to the performance of these Terms of Service and/or the Primary Agreement, and/or related to the Site, Software, Platform, Documentation or Services, including, without limitation, algorithms, APIs, rules and formulae, software, source code, copyright, techniques, sketches, drawings, models, know-how, registered and unregistered designs, business plans, financial information, business names, domain names, inventions, trademarks, trade secrets and proprietary information, apparatus, equipment, information relating to past, present, future or proposed products and services of Semaphore, such as information concerning research and development work, design details, customer lists, business forecasts, sales and marketing plans, and all such other information which may be revealed to the Customer for the purpose(s) described in these Terms of Service or the Primary Agreement, in any form (whether disclosed orally, in hard copy, electronic, or otherwise), and regardless of the fact whether the information has been marked as confidential or not.

## 13. Term and termination

These Terms of Service shall begin to apply on the Effective Date and continue in effect until terminated. Subject to conditions from Sections 4 and 5 of these Terms of Service, the license to use the Services shall last for the period for which the fees, defined by Semaphore and the Customer mutually, have been orderly paid, starting from the Effective Date (Initial Term). Upon expiration of the Initial Term, the Services shall automatically renew for a subsequent renewal term of equal length to the then-current Initial Term (each a Renewal Term) unless (i) otherwise set forth in the Primary Agreement; (ii) the Primary Agreement or these Terms of Service are terminated; or (iii) if Semaphore or the Customer provide notice of non-renewal no less than sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term (in written or electronic form).

Continued access to the Free Plan beyond this initial term is subject to review and explicit written confirmation of renewal by Semaphore. Semaphore may, at its sole discretion, decline to renew the Free Plan if the Customer no longer meets the eligibility criteria or if the Customer fails to respond to requests for confirmation of eligibility.

Semaphore reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Customer's access to the Free Plan immediately if Semaphore determines, or has reasonable grounds to believe, that the Customer no longer meets the eligibility criteria and has failed to notify Semaphore accordingly. Customers are required to promptly notify Semaphore of any changes that would affect their eligibility for the Free Plan, including but not limited to exceeding the revenue or users thresholds.

Customer may stop accessing and using the Services, at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately and without right to reimbursement of fees paid under the Primary Agreement or these Terms of Service, including for the proportion of the period in which the Customer did not use the Services but has paid appropriate fees for. Customer may terminate its registration and account at any time by sending an email to billing@semaphoreci.com that includes Customer's electronic mail address and username.

Upon any termination, all rights and obligations of the parties shall cease, and Customer shall immediately cease using the Service, except that (a) all obligations that accrued prior to the effective date of termination (including without limitation, all payment obligations) and all remedies for breach of the Terms of Service shall survive and (b) the provisions of Sections 8, 11 – 20 shall survive. After termination or any continuous 6-month period of inactivity, Semaphore has no obligation to maintain any content in Customer's account or to forward any unread or unsent messages to Customer or any other User or third party.

## 14. Disclaimer of all warranties

## 16. Indemnification

Customer agrees to (a) defend Semaphore and its affiliates, licensors and suppliers, and their employees, contractors, officers, directors and representatives against any action or suit by a third party that arises out of any transaction or other dealings with any other user or other third party in which Customer is involved, Customer's use or misuse of the Service, or Customer's breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants under the Terms of Service or Primary Agreement and (b) indemnify the indemnitees for settlement amounts or damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) awarded and arising out of any such claim.

Semaphore reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by Customer, in which case Customer will provide Semaphore with all reasonable information, cooperation and assistance to defend, compromise or settle the claim. To the extent it is not possible under applicable law for Semaphore to formally exclusively assume defense from the Customer in the respective proceedings, the Customer agrees to undertake any action which would ensure that Semaphore assumes and controls the defense in practice by following any and all instructions provided by Semaphore (or persons authorized by it) in the defense of claims (including the instruction on which legal counsel to choose), as well as to undertake any action that might be necessary in order for Semaphore to participate in the respective proceedings (to the extent possible).

## 17. International use

Semaphore makes no representation that the Site or Services are appropriate or legally available for use in locations outside Serbia and the United States, and accessing and using the Service is prohibited from territories where doing so would be illegal. Accessing or using the Services from other locations may be done at Customer's own initiative and Customer will be responsible for compliance with all local laws.

Customer expressly consents to Semaphore's processing of personal information in accordance with the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Customer understands and agrees that its personal information may be stored, processed and transferred in the country where it was collected and in Serbia, and that Serbian laws regarding the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal information may be less stringent than the laws where Customer is located. If Customer is a business or other entity, then it agrees that each person who accesses or uses the Site or Services through Customer's account has given express consent to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of his or her personal information as provided herein, unless such processing of his or her personal information is otherwise allowed under applicable law.

A printed version of the Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

The Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Serbia, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. In the event of any conflict between Serbian and foreign laws, rules and regulations, Serbian laws, rules and regulations shall govern. Neither the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods nor any implementation of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act in any jurisdiction shall apply to the Terms of Service. Customer expressly agrees that the exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service or use of the Site or Services shall be filed only in the state or state courts located in Serbia, and Customer further agrees and submits to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action. Customer is not authorized to use the Site or Services in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Terms of Service, including without limitation, this section.

## 19. General provisions

The Terms of Service (including the Policies, and together with any Primary Agreement) are the entire agreement between Customer and Semaphore with respect to the Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between Customer and Semaphore with respect to the Services. If any provision of the Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

Customer's rights and obligations under the Terms of Service are personal to Customer, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by Customer except with Semaphore's prior written consent. Semaphore may assign, transfer, subcontract or delegate this Agreement and/or any or all of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. All waivers, consents and modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time or for any period (including without limitation, Semaphore's failure to enforce any use restriction) will not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Service or Terms of Service, and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.

Customer acknowledges that (a) it has read and understands the Terms of Service, (b) the Terms of Service have the same force and effect as a signed agreement, (c) Semaphore requires identification of the Customer before providing any Service or issuing any license and (d) neither the provision of any Service nor issuance of any license constitutes general publication of the Software or any other part of the Platform.
