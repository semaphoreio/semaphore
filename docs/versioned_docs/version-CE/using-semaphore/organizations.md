This page explains how to set up [notifications](./notifications), manage users, and what settings are available in your Semaphore instance. On Semaphore Community Edition, we use the terms server, instance, and organization interchangeably.

## Overview {#overview}

In order to access any non-public resources on Semaphore you must be invited to the Semaphore instance.

If you are trying out Semaphore for the first time, we suggest the [Guided Tour](../getting-started/guided-tour), where we show how to get started quickly.

A Semaphore instance has:

- zero or more [projects](./projects)
- one or more owners
- users [role-based permissions](./rbac)
- a dedicated URL, for example, `https://semaphore.example.com`

## Managing users {#people}

Semaphore users a [Role Based Access Control](./rbac) model to manage permissions at the instance level.

To manage users in your Semaphore instance, open the server menu and select **People**. This tab shows users and groups in your instance along with their roles and groups.

### How to create users {#add-people}

To create new accounts, go to the poeple option in the server menu and follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Press **Add people**

    ![Add people button](./img/add-people-button.jpg)

2. Type the email of the persons you wish to invite
3. Optionally, set a username. If not provided, the username is inferred from the email
4. When you are done adding users, press **Create Accounts**

    ![Add user screen](./img/add-user.jpg)

5. Take note of the temporary passwords for each account

    ![Temporary password](./img/temp-password.jpg)

6. When the new user first logs in with the temporary password, they will be prompted to create a new one. After that, they can start using Semaphore normally.

</Steps>

### How to change a user role {#role-change}

To change user roles, go to the poeple option in the server menu and follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Press the **Edit** button next to the user you want to change

    ![Edit button](./img/edit-button-people.jpg)

2. Select the new role

    ![Change role button](./img/change-role.jpg)

</Steps>


### How to reset a user password {#reset-password}

To reset a user password, go to the poeple option in the server menu and follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Press the **Edit** button next to the user you want to change

    ![Edit button](./img/edit-button-people.jpg)

2. Press the **Reset password** button

    ![Reset password button](./img/change-role.jpg)

3. Press **Reset password**

4. A new temporary password will be generated

5. When the user logs in with the temporary password they will be prompted to create a new password

</Steps>

### How to remove users {#remove-users}

Users can only be removed from the instance when they don't own any projects. You must [transfer the ownership](./projects#owner-change) of all the user's projects before they can be removed from Semaphore.

To remove a user, go to the people option in the server menu and follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Transfer any [project ownership](./projects#owner-change) the user may have to another individual. The user must not own any projects
2. Press the **X** button next to the username of the user you want to remove

  ![Removing a user from the organization](./img/remove-user.jpg)

</Steps>

Upon removal, access to all projects in Semaphore are revoked.

:::note

Only an Admins and Owners can remove users from the Semaphore instance.

### How to view permissions for roles {#org-roles}

Semaphore provides pre-defined roles. These permissions cannot be changed. You can see what actions each role can perform by following these steps:

<Steps>

1. Open the server **Settings** menu
2. Select **Roles**
    ![Settings Role location](./img/settings-roles.jpg)
3. In the **Organization Roles** section, press the eye button next to the role you want to examine

</Steps>

The actions with enabled checkbox are allowed for that role.

![Organization admin allowed actions](./img/org-admin-roles.jpg)

## Instance settings {#org-settings}

To access your settings, open the server menu and click on **Settings**.

![Organization settings location](./img/org-settings-location.jpg)

### General settings {#general-settings}

This page shows the main settings for your instance. Here, you can change its name, and control how [workflows](./workflows) run.

![General settings](./img/organization-settings-general.jpg)

:::info

The *URL of your server* is the URL that leads to the Home page in your Semaphore instance. For example `semaphore.example.com`

:::

### Notifications {#slack-notifications}

You can set up Slack and other webhook-based notifications to get your team notified whenever there [project](./projects) finishes running.

To learn more, see the [notification documentation](./notifications.md)

### Initialization agent {#init-agent}

Some types of pipelines require [initialization job](./pipelines#init-job) to evaluate and compile the them before the workload beings.

Semaphore tries to pick the best type of agent automatically but you change it for the whole server. This is particularly useful when you are using [self-hosted agents](./self-hosted).

To change the initialization job agent for all your [projects](./projects) in your Semaphore instance, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Select **Initialization job** from the settings menu
2. Select the **Environment type**
3. Select the **Machine type**
4. Select the **OS image** (if available)
5. Press **Save**

  ![Customizing a the initialization job agent](./img/organization-settings-initialization.jpg)

</Steps>

:::info

If you experience errors during initialization, see the [initialization job logs](./pipelines#init-logs) to help troubleshoot the issue.

## Project queues {#queue}

You can use queues to control the order in which pipelines are executed in your instance. See [named queues](./pipelines#named-queues) for more information.

## Activity monitor {#activity-monitor}

The activity monitor show the [agent](./pipelines#agents) utilization and the currently running pipelines.

To view the activity monitor, open your server menu and select **Activity Monitor**.

![Activity monitor location](./img/activity-monitor-location.jpg)

In the activity monitor, you can see the machine quota utilization for your instance. Here, you can have an overview on how Semaphore Cloud machines and [self-hosted agents](./self-hosted) are being used.

![Activity monitor quotas](./img/activity-monitor-quotas.jpg)

In the lower part of the activity monitor you can find the currently running workflows for all the [projects](./projects) in your instance. Use this to know what [jobs](./jobs) are running, and see which ones are waiting in the queue to debug usage issues.
