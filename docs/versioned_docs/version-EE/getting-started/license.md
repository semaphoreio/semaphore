This page explains how to obtain a Semaphore Enterprise Edition (EE) license and under which conditions you must pay to run your Semaphore EE instance.

## Overview {#overview}

Every Semaphore EE instance must have a valid and current license to run. The license is applied during installation and renewed yearly.

## Free Enterprise Edition {#free}

You might not need to pay for the license. If the following conditions apply, you can get a 100% free license and skip payment altogether:

- You expect to have fewer than 50 users for the Semaphore instance
- Your company must have less than $ 5,000,000 US Dollars ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)

A free Enterprise Edition server license includes every feature in the paid license without any limitations. The only difference is that a free license does not include advanced support or any SLAs. Free support is provided on a best-effort basis via the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FBuUrV24NH).
