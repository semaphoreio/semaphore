This page explains how to obtain a Semaphore Enterprise Edition (EE) license and under which conditions you are required to pay to run your Semaphore EE instance.

## Overview {#overview}

Every Semaphore EE instance must have a valid and current license in order to run. The license is applied during installation.

- You have at most 50 Semapahore users (or 50 employees?)
- Your company must have less than 5,000,000 US Dollars ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)

If you do not fulfill these requirements, you must [contact support for payment details] once you install your Semaphore instance.

<Steps>

1. Go to the [Semaphore License Hub](https://license-server.test.sonprem.com/)

4. Fill in the verification code sent to the provided email
