## Overview

[MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.info/) (Model Context Protocol servers) connect AI models to external data and tools through a standardized interface. They provide structured, real-time context—like data from APIs so models can retrieve accurate information and perform actions securely and consistently.

You can connect your favorite AI agent with Semaphore using the official MCP Server. This allows the AI agent or IDE to access the activity in your organization using a conversational interface. With MCP you can now ask your AI agent why your build failed and to provide a fix.

## MCP Server Capabilities {#tools}

Semaphore's MCP Server provides read-only access to the following parts of your organization:

- Workflows
